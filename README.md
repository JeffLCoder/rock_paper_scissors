1. add 3 buttons for selection
2. change result output from console.log to html



first JS exercise in the Odin projects


the pseudocode below breaks down the task into a few small steps:
//keep the scores
//generate random input from computer
//get input from player
  //reject if the input from user is none of the 3 words
  //return undefined if play's input is invalid
//one round of the game
  //check if player's input is valid, otherwise interrupt the process
    // rock=0, paper=1, scissors=2, player wins only if the remainder of player-computer is 1 or -2
//play the game for x rounds
